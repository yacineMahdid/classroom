# The quickstart guide to YouTube 
- Already know how to get started though (OffBeatLook)
- Watch time is super important for youtube recommendation
- Need to have 1000 subscribers and 4000h of watch time to start monetizing a channel
- other than that this didn't taught me much, its more for people not knowing how it works (already did know with hennackg)

# Get discovered 
- Youtube recommender is trying to follow the audience
- Thumbnails needs to be visually appealing and have good depth, needs to be able to understand what it is when its very small.
- The description should describe the video, the first few lines appear on the research page. Need to have good two lines.
- Cards encourage viewers to take actions, should use that when I'm talking about previous video. Cards should pop up towards the end of the video.
- Building an audience: Needs to have a constant schedule.
- Collaboration is nice and allows the two subscribers to move in between the channels.

# Before your shoot 
- DSLR, phone or point-shoot
- People cannot stand bad sound
- Camera mic sucks
- Should check out shotgon mic or lavaliere

# After your shoot
- For editing: do multiple take of shot, do wide shot, play around with the zooming.
- backup your stuff.
- organize your edit steps.
- organize your shots in folder.
- watch your footage (all of it)
- then you begin to edit: lay out all of your best shot one after the other in the timeline
- after that cut the video downs, remove all the hum and ah. Make the video move in a quick and efficient way.
- transistion is how you add variety.
- watch over and over your video to have a feeling of where something slow down too much. Fresh perspective is good when seen the video too much.
- Using title card helps and B rolls which support the narrative (it helps people stay engage and draw attention).
- In-screen imagery is good for the end fo the video, can put something there to remind people to subscribe.
- Record your sound well and put good music to set the tone.
- Mixing of your sound is important so that people can understand what you say (listen to the video multiple time to catch part where the music is too loud)
- Color correction can help.
