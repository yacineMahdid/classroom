    "- It introduce pandas\n",

    "- content also straightforward and simple\n",

    "# Your First Machine Learning Model\n",
    "- df.columns will show you the column name in your dataframe\n",
    "- dropna(axis=0) will drop missing values\n",
    "- Serie is like a dataframe with a single column\n",
    "- good practice with model having randomness is to define a seed (random state)\n",
    "- the exercices were pretty much the kind you just have to type the stuff hey ask you too, however its a good one to demistify the tools we are using.\n",

    "# Model Validation\n",
    "- MAE = mean absolute error: on average or prediction are off by X\n",
    "- In sample score is using the same data for both the training and test data\n",
    "- When we use data from outside the training data (validation data) we can calculate the out sample score\n",
    "- a good value for MAE depends largely on the range of value possible for the dataset and our error tolerance\n",

    "# Random Forest\n",
    "- Super simple module which go quickly on why RF are better than normal decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "# Machine Learning Competition\n",
    "- Their exercice is a bit broken, will download the data and train my model locally"
