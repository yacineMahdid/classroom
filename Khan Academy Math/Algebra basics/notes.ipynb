    "# Foundations\n",
    "- Once again I'm doing only exercices until I find it difficult then I look at the videos.\n",
    "- The exponent section is actualy challenging when there is only fractions.\n",
    "- Just learned how to simplify square roots using prime factorization, feel smart.\n",
    "- Did the same with variables and its the same process\n",
    "- I've internalized the order of operation as I didn't even need to double check the video, this shows that taking the time to do a lot of exercise on a subject will pay off in the long term.\n",
    "- I'm looking at calculating the area of triangle, it's actually half of that of a parallelogram `area_triangle = base*height/2`\n",
    "- The area of a circle is given by `A=pi*r^2` where r is the radius\n",
    "- Also the circumference of a circle is `C=2pi*r`\n",
    "- We can relate both of them and have `A = (C^2) / (4*pi)\n",
    "- I decided to stop a section as soon as I hit the mastery level of 5 out of 6. Otherwise its just too time consuming for not much.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algebraic Expression\n",
    "- The exercices are okay, not too bad not too hard\n",
    "- simplifying fraction of fraction was actually challenging, but I get it now!\n",
    "- The unit test was great too, I feel like I get to the point where it starts to be challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear Equation and Inequalities\n",
    "- So far it's not too bad, it's mainly about solving for an unknown variable\n",
    "- Unit test was difficult because I was trying to rush in, should go slowly on these and make sure to double check what I did.\n",
    "- I just realized I dislike word problem because it's long to parse. Should be careful with them to go slow on the parsing.\n",
    "- Also, Using the calculator now makes more sense since I've been calculating everything by hand. It's nice to get some practice re-doing this after many years, however it's time consuming and error prone.\n",
    "- went slower on the exercices that I got a bit more difficulties in and was able to get 100% on the unit instead of 60%! Was able to get mastery on that subject by going slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graphing lines and slope\n",
    "- Quadrant goes Right-Up = 1, Left-Up = 2, Left-Down = 3, Right-Down=4\n",
    "- the exercises are not too bad, simple but it's a good refresher on the subject!\n",
    "- Once again going super slow on some of the part is super helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Systems of equations\n",
    "- Going slowly is not enough, the work needs to be clean to get to the right solution.\n",
    "- When solving systems of equations I got to be really careful of the signs, I tend to disregard to minuses.\n",
    "- Now that I go more slowly I almost always get 100%, if I double check my work at the end it's almost impossible to make a mistake on these kind of problems.\n",
