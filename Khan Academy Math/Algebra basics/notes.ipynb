    "- Once again I'm doing only exercices until I find it difficult then I look at the videos.\n",
    "- The exponent section is actualy challenging when there is only fractions.\n",
    "- Just learned how to simplify square roots using prime factorization, feel smart.\n",
    "- Did the same with variables and its the same process\n",
    "- I've internalized the order of operation as I didn't even need to double check the video, this shows that taking the time to do a lot of exercise on a subject will pay off in the long term."
