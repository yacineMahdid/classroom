    "- Once again I'm doing only exercices until I find it difficult then I look at the videos.\n",
    "- The exponent section is actualy challenging when there is only fractions.\n",
    "- Just learned how to simplify square roots using prime factorization, feel smart.\n",
    "- Did the same with variables and its the same process\n",
    "- I've internalized the order of operation as I didn't even need to double check the video, this shows that taking the time to do a lot of exercise on a subject will pay off in the long term.\n",
    "- I'm looking at calculating the area of triangle, it's actually half of that of a parallelogram `area_triangle = base*height/2`\n",
    "- The area of a circle is given by `A=pi*r^2` where r is the radius\n",
    "- Also the circumference of a circle is `C=2pi*r`\n",
    "- We can relate both of them and have `A = (C^2) / (4*pi)\n",
    "- I decided to stop a section as soon as I hit the mastery level of 5 out of 6. Otherwise its just too time consuming for not much.\n",

    "- The exercices are okay, not too bad not too hard\n",
    "- simplifying fraction of fraction was actually challenging, but I get it now!\n",
    "- The unit test was great too, I feel like I get to the point where it starts to be challenging\n",
