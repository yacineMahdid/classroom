    "- There is a lot of exerice in this unit, however they are not too bad. There is like 4100 points to get which is the double of what was in the previous section.\n",
    "- I reviewed the exercices again and it wasn't too bad. However, I should necessarly aim to get the max number of points for a given section since it is very time consuming. I should instead aim to do some amount of review in the early material, then jump to exactly the material I want to learn (namely the Linear Algebra and Calculus part).\n"
