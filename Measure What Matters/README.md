# Google, Meet OKRs
This is a nice introduction story on how Google was introduced to OKRs. Its cool to see that they were shown that early on and that they adopted the methodology so young in their development.
In my opinion it gives more credibility to the fact that OKRs works than if google was already massively succesful before implementing the methodology.
This chapter also give an overview of how to set a Objective and the corresponding Key Results. This chapter is actually all someone need to read to be sold on the subject and to understand what are OKRs.

# The Father of OKRs
This chapter is more of a explanation of where the OKRs idea come from. It showcase Andy Grove, which wrote high output management. It shows the spirit and mindset of OKR.

# Operation Crush: An Intel Story
This chapter is one of many exemple of OKRs done right which give tremendous weight on the subject. If the book was simply an explanation of how to use OKR it will be 10 time smaller. The exemple are there to sell us the idea and show us
the many way OKRs can be used. It's great.

# Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities
This chapter show one aspect that OKRs improve in a company/individual. By having set rules of about how many OKRs you can have it allows one to focus on the highest priority stuff and generate the most value.

# Focus: The Remind Story
This is an exemple of how OKR allowed for a company to focus on what was important. It's actually a good exemple I've seen some similarity with my startup there.

# Commit: The Nuna Story
This shows how OKR allowed Nuna, a health-care company, to commit to what was important during pivots. That was also a great exemple and show why the google mindset brings about good entrepreneurs.

# Superpower #2: Align and Connect Teamwork
This chapter shows how OKRs improve team cohesion by letting everyone understand what the priority of the company are. This concept was already touched upon in operation Crush.

# Align: The MyFitnessPal Story
This chapter showcase how OKRs helped the engineering team focus on what mattered during a scaling and how everyone could understand what was important to do + what every other team were working on.

# Connect: The Intuit Story
This chapter also shows how to coordinate a large company like intuit during transformation phase. It was ok.

# Superpower #3: Track for Accountability
This showcase theoreticaly how having OKR make people more accountable for what they are doing by having objectives that everyone aggree one before. If something happens along the way and something is dropped there are no hardfeeling, just explanation
that needs to be given. Great because it remove subjectivity.

# Track: The Gates Foundation Story
This chapter was great since we already know that Bill is a potent businessman. It was cool to see how having OKR made it possible to keep track of difficult problem as the org was making headway into ambiguous problem. Tracking is definetly something we should be doing more, but not in a intrusive way, more in following company objectives and making sure we know which are on-track.

# Superpower #4: Stretch for Amazing
This last 'power' of OKR shows how having goals that are aspirational would allow in theory to make big leap in the company/personal development. This one thing we should definetly add to our OKRs.

# Stretch: The Google Chrome Story and The Youtube Story
This was a nice piece by Sundar Pichai who explained how Google Chrome using stretch OKR got such a foothold into the browser market. That was sincerly eye opening to see a engineer have so much self-discipline and achieve consistent incredbile result. The following chapter about Youtube was also similarly eye opening. This is also a chapter that emphasis tracking as they could only achieve that stretch goal with youtube by having continuously tracking what was important.

# Continous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs
This chapter was nice, however I've never worked in a company that was doing end of the year review so I cannot relate. In my mind making touch-up weekly is the way to go, there is no rationale for doing it only once a year except if manager are lazy. The idea is to always understand how your team is going and what you can do/change to help them out.

# Ditching Annual Performance Reviews: The Adobe Story
This is an exemple of a huge corp ditching annual review and seeing super improvement. Can't relate really.

# Baking Better Every Day: The Zume Pizza Story
This is the chapter I hated. For me the Zume company makes absolutely no sense. Using super high technology to bake pizza (even if its healthier pizza) makes no sense in a business perspective. It doesn't look lean at all, I don't get how they got funded for such non-sense. They actually even pivoted away from pizza altogether to packaging which makes more sense. wtf

# Culture
This chapter shows how a good growth (devops) culture is needed for OKR to take holds.

# Culture Change: The Lumeris Story and Bono's ONE Campaign Story
This chapter highlight how culture sometime needs to be changed before OKR can take a hold. The other chapter with Bono show how OKR can change a culture, it was nice to hear Bono speak about the fact that he was a poor singer. Success is really about setting up goals, tracking them and doing the legwork.
