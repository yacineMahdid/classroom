# Google, Meet OKRs
This is a nice introduction story on how Google was introduced to OKRs. Its cool to see that they were shown that early on and that they adopted the methodology so young in their development.
In my opinion it gives more credibility to the fact that OKRs works than if google was already massively succesful before implementing the methodology.
This chapter also give an overview of how to set a Objective and the corresponding Key Results. This chapter is actually all someone need to read to be sold on the subject and to understand what are OKRs.

# The Father of OKRs
This chapter is more of a explanation of where the OKRs idea come from. It showcase Andy Grove, which wrote high output management. It shows the spirit and mindset of OKR.

# Operation Crush: An Intel Story
This chapter is one of many exemple of OKRs done right which give tremendous weight on the subject. If the book was simply an explanation of how to use OKR it will be 10 time smaller. The exemple are there to sell us the idea and show us
the many way OKRs can be used. It's great.

# Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities
This chapter show one aspect that OKRs improve in a company/individual. By having set rules of about how many OKRs you can have it allows one to focus on the highest priority stuff and generate the most value.

# Focus: The Remind Story
This is an exemple of how OKR allowed for a company to focus on what was important. It's actually a good exemple I've seen some similarity with my startup there.

# Commit: The Nuna Story
This shows how OKR allowed Nuna, a health-care company, to commit to what was important during pivots. That was also a great exemple and show why the google mindset brings about good entrepreneurs.

# Superpower #2: Align and Connect Teamwork
This chapter shows how OKRs improve team cohesion by letting everyone understand what the priority of the company are. This concept was already touched upon in operation Crush.

# Align: The MyFitnessPal Story
This chapter showcase how OKRs helped the engineering team focus on what mattered during a scaling and how everyone could understand what was important to do + what every other team were working on.

# Connect: The Intuit Story
This chapter also shows how to coordinate a large company like intuit during transformation phase. It was ok.

# Superpower #3: Track for Accountability
This showcase theoreticaly how having OKR make people more accountable for what they are doing by having objectives that everyone aggree one before. If something happens along the way and something is dropped there are no hardfeeling, just explanation
that needs to be given. Great because it remove subjectivity.
