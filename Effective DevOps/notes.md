# Chapter 1: The Big Picture
Cool overview of the experience of the autors on devops at Etsy and Yahoo. Basically, their work sucked before and now its on the path of being really good!

# Chapter 2: What is DevOps?
This part shows how communication is important where we give enough slack to employee to do the thing we need, but we still verify with them that everything is fine. The analogy is like rock-climbing with a partner. You need to communicate while the other guy is climbing up, otherwise it doesn't really work.

# Chapter 3: A History of Devops
This was actually a nice segment about the historical perspective of the movement and from where the separation between dev and ops came to be. 

# Chapter 4: Foundational Terminology and Concepts
In this chapter the authors discuss some key terminology to understand what specific concept devops is concentrating on. There is a nice overview of common dev, ops and systems methodology : Waterfall, Agile + Scrum, ITIL, COBIT and **Lean**. Here is a list of some devops concepts:
- Version Control
- Test-Driven Development
- Application Deployment
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment
- Minimal Viable Product
- Configuration Management
- Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure Automation
- Artifact Management
- Containers
- Retrospective
- Postmortem
- Blamelessness
- Organizational Learning

# Chapter 5: Devops Misconceptions and Anti-Patterns
This first part of the chapter is like a Q&A but with wrong question from someone who doesn't understand Devops. If I was working with someone that doubt the movement I would make him read this chapter. The second part is stuff that are clearly not devops like Blame Culture and Silos.
