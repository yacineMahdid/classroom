# Chapter 1: The Big Picture
Cool overview of the experience of the autors on devops at Etsy and Yahoo. Basically, their work sucked before and now its on the path of being really good!

# Chapter 2: What is DevOps?
This part shows how communication is important where we give enough slack to employee to do the thing we need, but we still verify with them that everything is fine. The analogy is like rock-climbing with a partner. You need to communicate while the other guy is climbing up, otherwise it doesn't really work.

# Chapter 3: A History of Devops
This was actually a nice segment about the historical perspective of the movement and from where the separation between dev and ops came to be. 

# Chapter 4: Foundational Terminology and Concepts
In this chapter the authors discuss some key terminology to understand what specific concept devops is concentrating on. There is a nice overview of common dev, ops and systems methodology : Waterfall, Agile + Scrum, ITIL, COBIT and **Lean**. Here is a list of some devops concepts:
- Version Control
- Test-Driven Development
- Application Deployment
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment
- Minimal Viable Product
- Configuration Management
- Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure Automation
- Artifact Management
- Containers
- Retrospective
- Postmortem
- Blamelessness
- Organizational Learning

# Chapter 5: Devops Misconceptions and Anti-Patterns
This first part of the chapter is like a Q&A but with wrong question from someone who doesn't understand Devops. If I was working with someone that doubt the movement I would make him read this chapter. The second part is stuff that are clearly not devops like Blame Culture and Silos.

# Chapter 6: Four Pillars of Effective DevOps
This was a short summary presentation of what the four core point of effective devops are and their definitions:
- Collaboration
- Affinity
- Tools
- Scaling
Contrary to popular belief the emphasis is on the people and their interaction more than on the tools.

# Chapter 7: Collaboration : Individuals Working Together
This was an overview of collaboration in the context of software engineering and all of the parameters that goes with it.
It also showed how to instill collaboration in a company by promoting the right process and cultivating the right growth mindset. The central idea of DevOps revolve around this growth mindset which is defined as continuous learning.
Teams are way more important than a single high performing individual.
This chapter also highlighted how communication is complex and need to be given enough attention (for instance by giving a good though about which channel to communicate something).
The core quality of effective Devops is empathy and trust, these needs to be present and instilled in all team members.

# Chapter 8: Collaboration: Misconceptions and Troubleshooting
Companion chapter for the previous one for common problem/misunderstanding that can come around when collaborating. It's a good reference for a manager to read (this and the other Q&A chapter that will follow).

# Chapter 9: Affinity from Individuals to Teams
This chapter is about how to make peoplework together and how to foster affinity which is a kind of relationship work within/across teams. They show what consideration needs to be taken into account when we want to increase team cohesion wihtout creating silos. All the tricks to increase a team empathy involve being generous in nature in the right way. To foster affinity we need the following:
- Slack (vacation time + time off)
- **Explicit values & goals**
- Physical space for creating affinity
- Room for collaboration and cooperation

# Chapter 10: Affinity: Misconception & Troublehooting
Another companion chapter, good to check from time to time.

# Chapter 11: Tools: Ecosystem Overview
Nice overview of the type of tools used in DevOps without going in details about them.
- Local Development Environment (need to be constant)
- Version Control
- Artifact Management (in a repository)
- Server Installation (on-premise)
- **Infrastructure Automation (Need to do more of that)**
- System Provisioning
- Test + Build Automation
- **Monitoring (We don't do enough of that)**

# Chapter 12: Tools: Accelerator of Culture
This is an overview of how tools are affecting people within an organization and how our decision as manager will affect tools/culture. One important phrase that was stated was that tools affects culture, but won't fix a broken one. **There was a cool case study of DramaFever and Etsy tooling process. Would read again if only for these last case study**.
