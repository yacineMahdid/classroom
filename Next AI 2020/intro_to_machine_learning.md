# Intro. to Machine Learning
This was the first course in the Next AI curiculum as of 2020 (fully remote because of the COVID-19 pandemic)
It was taught by [Dr. Laurent Charlin](https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/laurent.charlin.html)
Here are my raw notes:

Introduction to AI (the first part was very similar to Dr. Pineau introduction to machine learning):
- GAN are getting popular to generate assets
- Neural network are getting better at captioning
- Neural nets are approaching human level performance at translation
- Suprisingly AI agent can generate stories given a prompt quite well
- Deep Q Learning is great to learn video game like environment (reinforcement learning)

Machine learning:
- Learn by example with labels (supervised)
- Goal of ml is to find the right model complexity for the data to fit properly
- Linear regression is an exemple of a ml model
- The non-linear regression version of it is what is composing neural network cells.
- If tabular data, def go for Random forest or XGBoost
- DNN can do end to end learning
- Three big kind of architecture are: CNN, RNN and Graph CNN


ML vs Stats
- ML is all about prediction, stats is about understanding the data

Why now is deep learning taking off?
- It was rebranded to be cool
- we have massive dataset available
- GPU & TPU are now available which are really good at doing linear algebra fast

AI in MTL 
- Back in the days there was the Lisa Lab at Udem and RLLab at McGill
- Now there is the MILA which is a huge hub for ML

Tech Program
- It's all about AI/ML fluency (we will have more breadth than depth compared to previous years)
- We will have three kind of classes (Core, Hand-son and Aspirational)
- There are Scientist in Residence which are there to help us out, they will be assigned to us (first line of support)

# Aside
- To keep track of the community look out for twitter and blog posts
- One central problem in ML right now is how to do higher level reasoning
