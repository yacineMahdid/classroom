    "# Introduction to Storage on AWS\n",
    "- Relation database is AWS RDS\n",
    "- S3 is great for image, video, text files (object level storage)\n",
    "- RDS has block level storage, the above are not fit for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elastic Block Storage (EBS)\n",
    "- Boot and data volume attached to EC2 instances are independent of it\n",
    "- If you stop an EC2 instance the EBS survives\n",
    "- You can even swap EC2 instance EBS storage (it's more like an external HD)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Storage System (S3)\n",
    "- S3 buckets are accessible over HTTP and HTTPS\n",
    "- Limit of 5 TB for uploaded object, however no limits for the amount of data in the buckets\n",
    "- Like EC2 instance we can decide where the bucket will be hosted for optimized latency\n",
    "- I need to go to permission to set a bucket to public\n",
    "- **If want to share object by making them public I have to do it at the individual object level**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elastic File System\n",
    "- EBS lives inside one subnet, but not EFS\n",
    "- If many EC2 instance need to access the same storage file system EFS is the way to go\n",
    "\n",
    "# Databases\n",
    "- Two main type of databases Relational and NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Database Service\n",
    "- This is a SQL type of database that is managed by AWS\n",
    "- We can put our database in a EC2 instance and have a lot taken care of by AWS\n",
    "- RDS manage a lot of the thing for us excepted the app optimization part which has to be taken care by us (and which make sense).\n"
